# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **learning repository** for Claude Code itself—a complete Spanish-language course teaching users how to use Claude Code from beginner to advanced level.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Welcome page and course navigation
- `COURSE_OUTLINE.md` - Complete curriculum with 10 chapters
- `capitulo_XX.md` - Individual chapter files (lessons, exercises, and exams)
- Exported conversation logs (format: `YYYY-MM-DD-*.txt`)

## Content Architecture

The course follows a progressive learning structure:

1. **Chapters 1-3**: Beginner level (basics, file ops, Git)
2. **Chapters 4-5, 8**: Intermediate (tools, slash commands, output styles)
3. **Chapters 6-7, 9-10**: Advanced (agents, hooks, MCP, workflows)

Each chapter includes:
- Learning objectives
- Lessons (sections 1.1, 1.2, etc.)
- Practice exercises
- End-of-chapter exam
- Progress tracking mechanism

## Working with This Repository

### When Users Request Chapter Content
- Users are learning Claude Code features *by using Claude Code itself*
- They may ask to start chapters, check exercises, or submit exams
- Review their exam answers as their instructor
- Mark chapters as completed in README.md when they pass

### When Modifying Course Content
- All content is in Spanish
- Maintain consistent formatting across chapters
- Keep exercises practical and hands-on
- Exams should test understanding, not memorization
- Use emojis for visual navigation (as established in existing files)

### Git Workflow
- Standard Git operations apply
- No special build, test, or lint commands (documentation repository)
- When committing: follow standard commit message format

## Important Notes

- This is a **meta-learning environment**: users learn Claude Code by interacting with Claude Code
- Be encouraging as their instructor—learning should be enjoyable
- When explaining Claude Code features, you can demonstrate them in real-time
- The repository has no code dependencies or build steps—it's pure documentation
